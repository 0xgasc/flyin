## Environment Variables

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=

## Authentication Troubleshooting

### Clearing Persistent Auth Issues
If you experience login issues or infinite loading:

1. **Quick Clear:** Visit `/clear-auth` - Clears Supabase session and auth store
2. **Force Clear:** Visit `/force-clear` - Nuclear option that clears everything:
   - Supabase auth tokens
   - localStorage/sessionStorage
   - Cookies
   - IndexedDB
   - Service worker cache
3. **Admin Bypass:** Visit `/admin-bypass` - Complete auth reset with redirect

### Debug Mode
In development, a debug panel appears in bottom-right showing:
- Current auth state
- User email
- Profile role
- Force sign out button

## Data Import

### Bulk Import Script
Import experiences and destinations from CSV with images:

```bash
# Ensure CSV is at: scripts/experiences-data.csv
# Images in: /Users/gs/Downloads/FlyInGuate Paquetes/
npm run import-experiences
```

The script:
- Parses CSV data with pricing tiers
- Uploads images to IRYS
- Creates database records
- Handles metadata and relationships

## Admin Features

### Experience Management

- Manage pricing for different helicopters
- Toggle active/inactive status

### Booking Management  
- Filter by status (pending, approved, completed, cancelled)

- Manage metadata
- Set featured destinations

## Development

```bash

npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Deployment

The project auto-deploys to Vercel on push to main branch.

```bash
# Manual deployment
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push origin main
```

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Admin-only access for management features

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Auth State Persistence
- Chrome may cache auth aggressively

- Clear Chrome site data manually if needed

### Experience Deletion
- Check for related bookings first
- System warns about foreign key constraints
- Deletes cascade for experience_images

### Image Upload
- IRYS has 50MB file size limit
- Fallback to URL input if IRYS fails
- Images stored on Arweave blockchain
