## 🔒 Security Audit & Design Refresh (v2.1.0)
**Date:** January 23, 2026

### Security Hardening

#### 1. JWT Library Standardization
**File:** `src/middleware.ts`
- Replaced `jose` library with `jsonwebtoken` for consistency across codebase
- Removed async overhead (jose requires async, jsonwebtoken is synchronous)
- Unified JWT verification using `@/lib/jwt` utilities
- Improved performance and maintainability

#### 2. Security Measures Already in Place (Verified)
The following security best practices were confirmed to be implemented:

**JWT Secret Validation** (`src/lib/jwt.ts:4-13`)
- Application throws error on startup if `JWT_SECRET` environment variable not set
- No hardcoded fallback secrets
- Prevents deployment with default/weak secrets

**Error Sanitization** (All auth routes)
- Generic error messages returned to clients
- No stack traces or internal details exposed
- Files: `login/route.ts:72`, `me/route.ts:51`, `register/route.ts:106`

**Atomic Payment Operations** (`src/app/api/bookings/[id]/pay/route.ts:46-57`)
- Prevents TOCTOU (Time-of-check to Time-of-use) race conditions
- Uses MongoDB `findOneAndUpdate` with balance check in single atomic operation
- Concurrent payment requests cannot cause negative balances

**NoSQL Injection Prevention** (`src/app/api/bookings/route.ts:8-20`)
- Query parameters validated against enum whitelists
- Only valid status/type values accepted
- Prevents malicious query object injection

### Design System Overhaul: Sharp Corners

Completely redesigned UI from rounded corners to sharp edges for a modern, premium aesthetic.

#### Core Styles Updated (`src/styles/globals.css`)
```css
.btn-primary: rounded → rounded-none
.btn-luxury: rounded → rounded-none
.card-luxury: rounded → rounded-none
.modal-content: rounded → rounded-none
.status-badge: rounded → rounded-none
Form inputs: rounded → rounded-none
```

**Preserved:** `rounded-full` for loading spinners and avatars (functional requirement)

#### Components Updated (12 files)
1. **Modal.tsx** - All modal containers and buttons → `rounded-none`
2. **StatusBadge.tsx** - Badge borders → `rounded-none`
3. **booking-success-modal.tsx** - Modal and containers → `rounded-none`
4. **guest-booking-modal.tsx** - All inputs and buttons → `rounded-none`
5. **destination-selector-modal.tsx** - Modal, buttons, selection cards → `rounded-none`
6. **PhotoGallery.tsx** - Hover previews and control buttons → `rounded-none`

#### Pages Updated (6 major pages, 185 total changes)
| Page | Updates | Key Changes |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `page.tsx` (Landing) | 9 | Hero sections, booking form, service cards |
| `login/page.tsx` | 3 | Login form container and inputs |
| `register/page.tsx` | 8 | Registration form and buttons |
| `dashboard/page.tsx` | 25 | Dashboard cards, booking cards, action buttons |
| `admin/page.tsx` | 137 | Admin tables, modals, forms, status badges |
| `faq/page.tsx` | 3 | FAQ accordion panels |

#### Design Philosophy
- **Sharp edges** convey precision, professionalism, luxury
- **Consistent** across all UI elements (buttons, cards, modals, inputs)
- **Circular elements preserved** only where functionally necessary (spinners, avatars)
- **Modern aesthetic** aligned with premium helicopter service brand

### Build Verification
```bash
✓ Build successful (no TypeScript errors)
✓ 42 static pages generated
✓ All routes compiled successfully
```

### Files Modified
**Security:** 1 file
- `src/middleware.ts`

**Design:** 14 files

- 6 components: `Modal.tsx`, `StatusBadge.tsx`, `booking-success-modal.tsx`, `guest-booking-modal.tsx`, `destination-selector-modal.tsx`, `PhotoGallery.tsx`

## 🐛 Known Issues / TODOs

1. **User Wallet Balance**: Refund to wallet commented out because User model doesn't have `wallet_balance` field
   - Location: `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/refund/route.ts` lines 94-102
   - Need to add wallet_balance field to User model if wallet refunds are needed

2. **Payment Integration**: Invoice and receipt generation assume payment_date and transaction_id exist
   - May need to update based on actual payment gateway integration
